The Arlington Senior Citizens Center opened in the fall of 2003 to serve as a gathering place for Arlington’s senior citizens. The building is a replica of Arlington’s original railroad depot station from the late 1800s known as Withe Depot. Seniors (ages 50 and over) meet at the center to enjoy each other’s company in a variety of ways. Check out our monthly calendars for more information.

You fit here! Our community learns from each other, feels empowered through programs, and finds empathy, understanding, and determination as they navi-
gate life to the fullest. Here you will find engaging programs in art, music, fitness, education, current information, as well as access to a variety of other resources.
When we move toward seasons when outside activities are limited — use it as an opportunity to learn how to navigate our online programs. Virtual programs open a whole new world not only within our center, but they also allow connection with friends, family, and organizations across the world!
Our virtual/online programs do not require a membership. These are FREE to all adults 50+. To join in, please contact the center and we can help you get started. Each program we offer is also free unless noted on the calendar. In–person activ- ities are limited to current members only who have submitted the membership application and $12 annual fee as listed below.
Virtual programs are through Zoom with the latest privacy settings. Registra- tion is required to make this as secure as possible.
