The Arlington Senior Citizens Center opened in the fall of 2003 to serve as a gathering place for Arlington’s senior citizens. The building is a replica of Arlington’s original railroad depot station from the late 1800s known as Withe Depot. Seniors (ages 50 and over) meet at the center to enjoy each other’s company in a variety of ways. Check out our monthly calendars for more information.

You only need to commit and have a weekly telephone check–in. Call 901-867-7698 or email for more information.
